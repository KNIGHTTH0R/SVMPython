SVMPython
	A Support Vector Machine is binary classification algorithm utilized as a benchmark in many research articles as a baseline for comparison. This code is an SVM. It supervised models with associated learning algorithms that analyse data and recognize patterns.
I (with Lennard assistance) created a repo structure doc-src-res in my flash drive to save information during the research..
I downloaded MNIST dataset, Nanolab presentation format.
I went to codeacademy.com to learn more about python. this exercise is really helpful because it give me a understanding about python. i am still working on it because it challenging.
I created overleaf to write my paper.
I am still do not have a clear understanding of the support vector machine.
I can put some correct code in the "Hello World Python Tutorial" but not all of them because it confusing me.
read a document about Support vector machine for Regression: A succinct review of large scale and linear programming formulations. Lennard and I will go over it next week.
